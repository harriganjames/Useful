Hi Mike,

Thank you. Thank you very much. Simply speaking.. you are a gem :). Your contribution 
throughout the year has been superb. Your help on performance tuning, MiFID and many more 
items was instrumental to the success we have achieved this year.

Wish you a good year and looking forward to working with you next year.

Regards,
Nishant
